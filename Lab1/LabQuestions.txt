/*
1.) Explain one of the fundamental differences between signal() and sigaction() system calls:

One of the biggest differences is that sigaction is able to block different signals until
the initial handler returns whereas signal usually does not block other signals

2.) What is the purpose of SIGKILL if it cannot be intercepted?

SIGKILL is used as a last resort by operating systems. The most common example
I have found for the use of SIGKILL is that sometimes in operating system
shutdown, if the procedures do not want to exit, the system will call SIGKILL
which cannot be intercepted and can help speed up shutdown.
