Lab 1 ReadMe

Lab 1 is a word guessing game that prompts the user for letters and outputs them to the screen 
if they appear in the given word. The secret word is given as a command line arguement to the
executable file. If the user guesses an incorrect letter the program gives them a hint by giving 
them a free letter. There is also an Alarm that goes off if the user does not give a response 
within 5 seconds of the prompt. The program will run until the user gets all of the letters
correctly or if they give enough incorrect guesses and the program fills in all of the letters for
them. The program will also keep printing out the same word if the user keeps giving the same 
guess. There is also a cheat mode that reveals one of the hidden letters. If the user presses 
Ctrl + Z, a letter that has not been revealed yet will be printed to the screen.
