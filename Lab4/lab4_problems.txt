Jack Weissenberger Lab 4 questions

1. There are many critial sections of code in this problem. Any time the room is checked to see 
how many people are in the room, whenever the barber or cashier is checked and when the mutex is 
being checked.

2. If there was more than one barber, then we would need to change the barber from a binary 
semaphore to a counting semaphore and set it equal to 2 or however many barbers there were.
Then when a customer came in, they would need to check to see if each of the barbers were 
available before trying to take a seat to wait
