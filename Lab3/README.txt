CSC-241 - Lab 3

The purpose of this lab is to create a simple shell that executes linux commands using C. The
program prompts the user for a command, it is read into the program, the command is tokenized
and then the command is executed using the execvp call. 

Compile and Execution instructions:
Complie this program using the basic gcc command. Execute the file with ./"executable name"
NOTE: When the program asks you for a command, please put a space at the end of every command 
to ensure that it runs correctly.
